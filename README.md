Full-Stack Software Engineer Coding Challenge @ Acai Travel

## Explanation of my idea

My idea is to do a feedback assessment. This assessment is done using 
two models (explained in detail in the respective README).

## Challenges faced

Time was my biggest challenge. I wasn't able to have everything functioning in 5 hours. 
Due to time restrictions, I was unable to integrate the project with Docker. I know how 
the integration is done, but because I have already exceeded the maximum time I was not able to continue with this step.

## Improvements to be made

Regarding the frontend, my interface is preliminary, it could be improved with the 
help of a CSS framework. The code could be more optimized, that is, having the different
parts of the interface separated by components.

Regarding the backend, what can be improved is the addition of more models in order to have a better evaluation of the feedback introduced and also add more agents for 
a more assertive evaluation.

## Time Spent

I wasn't able to accomplish this task in 5 hours, there are still some things to do and 
others to improve. It took me about 6 hours to complete the challenge
